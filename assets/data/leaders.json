      "district": "Morang",
      "biography": "Sushila Karki (born 1952) is a Nepalese jurist and politician who made history as the first woman to serve as Chief Justice of Nepal’s Supreme Court (2016–2017). A strong anti-corruption voice with a reputation for integrity, she earned widespread respect during her tenure even as she drew sharp criticism from powerful interests. In September 2025, amid a youth-led anti-graft movement, Karki was tapped as a consensus choice for interim prime minister, becoming Nepal’s first female head of government. Her appointment underscored her standing as a nonpartisan reform figure in Nepali public life.\n\n## Early Life and Education  \nSushila Karki was born on 7 June 1952 in Biratnagar (Morang District) in eastern Nepal. She was the eldest of seven children in a farming family. Karki earned a Bachelor of Arts at Mahendra Morang College (Tribhuvan University) in 1972 and a Master’s in political science from Banaras Hindu University (India) in 1975, then completed a law degree at Tribhuvan University in 1978. Early in her career she taught at Mahendra Multiple Campus in Dharan and practiced law in Biratnagar. During Nepal’s pro-democracy Jana Andolan of 1990, Karki participated in the street protests against the autocratic Panchayat regime and was briefly jailed in Biratnagar for her activism. These early experiences – and her academic training – helped shape her lifelong commitment to democracy and rule of law.\n\n## Leadership and Political Positions  \nShe rose steadily through Nepal’s judicial ranks, becoming an ad-hoc justice of the Supreme Court in 2009 (confirmed in 2010). In July 2016 she was appointed Chief Justice of the Supreme Court, becoming Nepal’s first female Chief Justice. As Chief Justice she presided over several high-profile rulings, notably overturning the government’s appointment of a police chief and upholding graft convictions of senior officials. Her tenure was marked by an uncompromising stance against corruption, which earned her both respect and fierce pushback.  \n\nIn April 2017 the Maoist Centre and Nepali Congress parties filed an impeachment motion accusing Karki of bias after the court’s police-chief decision. Public protests and a Supreme Court order forced the legislature to withdraw the motion. Karki then retired on 6 June 2017, upon reaching Nepal’s mandatory retirement age for judges.  \n\nAfter leaving the bench, Karki remained a prominent civic leader and legal commentator, writing and speaking on governance and the rule of law. In September 2025, amid nationwide demonstrations demanding action on corruption, Nepal’s youth (“Gen Z” movement) selected her as their preferred interim prime minister. She was sworn in on 12 September 2025, making Karki the first woman to lead Nepal’s government. Protest organizers and observers highlighted her reputation for honesty, judicial independence, and firm anti-corruption credentials in explaining her appointment.\n\n## Strengths  \n- **Anti-corruption record:** Widely known for her zero-tolerance stance on graft, Karki issued outspoken rulings against corruption and pursued cases against senior officials.  \n- **Integrity and independence:** She built a reputation as an upright, impartial jurist. Many Nepalis view her as a principled outsider untainted by party politics.  \n- **Trailblazer for women:** As the first female Chief Justice and later first female prime minister, she broke longstanding gender barriers, becoming a role model for women in law and governance.  \n- **Nonpartisan credibility:** With no formal party affiliation, Karki is seen as a neutral figure acceptable to diverse groups in Nepal.  \n\n## Criticism  \n- **Impeachment controversy:** In 2017 leading politicians accused her of judicial overreach and bias, filing an impeachment motion that later collapsed under public pressure. Critics argued her forceful approach provoked unnecessary confrontation with the executive.  \n- **Lack of political experience:** Karki is a career judge with no background in elected politics or government administration. Some observers warn that this could limit her effectiveness as an executive leader.  \n- **Limited political base:** While embraced by anti-corruption activists and youth movements, she is not uniformly popular across Nepal’s fragmented political spectrum. Some established political groups were initially reluctant to support her appointment.  \n",

His formative public service experience includes time at the National Human Rights Commission and advisory work with Kathmandu Metropolitan City, shaping a pragmatic rights-oriented outlook.\n\n### Leadership and political positions\nUpon assuming office, Aryal publicly committed to reopening corruption-related files stalled by political influence and highlighted enforcement against vandalism and property damage during protests as part of a rule-of-law posture.

      "biography": "**Khadga Prasad Sharma Oli** (born 22 February 1952 in Iwa, Tehrathum) is a seasoned Nepali communist politician who has served as Prime Minister four times (Oct 2015–Aug 2016, Feb 2018–May/Jul 2021, and since July 2024). A veteran of Nepal’s Jhapa communist uprising, he survived 14 years underground and in prison before rising through the ranks of the CPN–UML. Known for his assertive nationalist stance—such as issuing a new political map and pivoting towards China—his leadership has led infrastructure initiatives and energy reforms. However, critics accuse him of authoritarianism, centralizing power, and practicing cronyism.\n\n---\n\n### **Early Life and Education**\n\nBorn into a farming household, Oli lost his mother to smallpox aged four and was raised by his grandmother. His family migrated to Jhapa, where he passed the SLC at Adarsha Secondary School in 1970. Inspired by Marxist–Leninist ideals and anti-Panchayat movements, he was encouraged early on by his uncle, Ramnath Dahal ([en.wikipedia.org][1]).\n\n---\n\n### **Political and Leadership Positions**\n\n* **Jhapa rebellion & imprisonment (1970s–1987):** Joined communist activism in 1970, went underground, was arrested in 1973, and spent 14 years in prison—including four in solitary confinement—under the Panchayat regime ([kids.kiddle.co][2]).\n* **Rise in CPN-UML:** After release, became a central committee member, co-founded the CPN–UML in 1991, served as Home Minister (1994–95), Deputy PM & Foreign Minister (2006–07), and was elected party chair in 2014 ([kids.kiddle.co][2]).\n* **Prime Ministerial tenures:** First appointed in Oct 2015 after the new constitution, returned to office in Feb 2018, briefly reappointed in May 2021 by the president, and assumed office again in July 2024 through a coalition with Nepali Congress ([kids.kiddle.co][2]).\n* **Falldown:** Allegedly responsible for the mass atrocity against youth-led protest against corruption that saw 50+ deaths and over 400 injured on September 08, 2025. Resigned and fled on September 09, 2025 unable to bear pressure from the Gen-Z led protest ([ictj.org][6]).\n\n---\n\n### **Strengths**\n\n* **Decisive nationalism:** Took bold stances like issuing a revised map including disputed areas, and rebalanced Nepal’s foreign policy by engaging deeply with China ([reuters.com][3]).\n* **Infrastructure & energy reforms:** Prioritized grid stability, expanded hydropower and road networks, and struck a petroleum deal with China after India’s blockade ([reuters.com][3]).\n* **Charismatic resilience:** His long imprisonment, ideological survival, and self-presentation as a principled communist resonate with his supporters .\n\n---\n\n### **Criticisms**\n\n* **Authoritarian tendencies:** Repeatedly accused of centralizing power, dissolving parliament (especially in 2020–21), and fostering personality-driven politics ([dawn.com][4]).\n* **Cronyism and democratic erosion:** Critics argue he favors loyalists, shields allies from accountability, and undermines institutional norms .\n* **Economic and governance concerns:** Detractors highlight slow delivery on promises, accusations of corruption (e.g., tea estate scandal), and handling of pandemic-related powers as problematic ([en.wikipedia.org][5]).\n\n---\n\n[1]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K._P._Sharma_Oli?utm_source=chatgpt.com \"K.
